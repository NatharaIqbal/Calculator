## Features

## Performance

The calculator is designed to provide fast and accurate calculations for basic arithmetic operations. It runs directly in the user's web browser, ensuring quick response times and minimal latency.

## How It Works

The calculator accepts input from the user via a graphical user interface (GUI) consisting of buttons for each digit, arithmetic operation, and special function. Users can input numbers and perform calculations using the provided buttons or by typing directly into the input field.

When an arithmetic operation is selected, the calculator updates the display in real-time to show the current expression being evaluated. Users can continue to add numbers, perform additional operations, or clear the input field as needed.

When the user selects the equals (=) button, the calculator evaluates the expression and displays the result in the input field.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/NatharaIqbal/calculator.git 
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the calculator to perform basic arithmetic calculations.
